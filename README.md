# Data-Cleaning-with-Python

I found this dataset on Kaggle and decided to clean it. I used Pandas library in Python to clean this messy data. In this dataset there were 76,377 rows and 9 columns including the Missing values. I wrote multiple for loops and if else statements to clean this data. The first picture illustrates how the original dataset looks like. The second picture illustrates the dataset after it was cleaned using Python.
