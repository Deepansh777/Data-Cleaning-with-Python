# Data-Cleaning-with-Python

I found this dataset on Kaggle and decided to clean it. I used Pandas library in Python to clean this messy data. In this dataset there were 76,377 rows and 9 columns including the Missing values. I wrote multiple for loops and if else statements to clean this data. 

- The first picture illustrates how the original dataset looks like. 
- The second picture illustrates the dataset after it was cleaned using Python.
